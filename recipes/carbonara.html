      and garlic; saute until brown and crisp, about 8 minutes. Remove from the heat and <br>
      cool slightly.</p>
    <h4>Step 3</h4>
    <p>Whisk cream, Parmesan, egg yolks, basil, and parsley together in a large bowl until<br>
       well blended</p>
    <h4>Step 4</h4>

       mixture. Toss over medium-low heat until chicken is heated through and sauce forms a <br>
       thick coating over the spaghetti, about 4 minutes. Do not boil or the eggs will scramble.<br>
       Season with salt and pepper and transfer to a large, wide serving bowl.</p>
